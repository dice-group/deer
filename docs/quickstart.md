# Quickstart

DEER is split into two maven submodules: **deer-core** and **deer-cli**.
While deer-core is intended to be used programmatically from other Java applications,
deer-cli provides a CLI to either run a single configuration or start the DEER server.

You can get the runnable deer-cli.jar from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/dice-group/deer/releases).\
Moreover, a Docker image of DEER is provided [on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dicegroup/deer) as `dicegroup/deer:latest` for fast access.
