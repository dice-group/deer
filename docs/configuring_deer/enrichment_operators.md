# Predefined Enrichment Operators

Here you will find a comprehensive list of the enrichment operators included in DEER, their degree
bounds, parameters and modes of operation.
If not specified otherwise, they need to have exactly one input and exactly one output dataset.

## Filter Enrichment Operator (`deer:FilterEnrichmentOperator`) {#filter}

The idea of the filter enrichment operator is to select a specific set of the input dataset triples.
Then, the selected set of triples are generated by the filter operator as its output.
The filter enrichment operator define the set of triple to be selected using either the single
parameter `deer:sparqlConstrucyQuery` or any number of `deer:selector`.

The `deer:sparqlConstructQuery` will accept a string literal that must be a valid SPARQL CONSTRUCT query,
which will then be applied to the input dataset in order to get the output.
This is most useful for manually composing complex filtering rules.  

On the other hand, the `deer:selector` parameter accepts a resource with at least one of the three basic
selectors types. i.e. the `deer:subject`, `deer:predicate` and `deer:object`, which can be combined as required.
For simple filtering tasks, e.g. if the task is to filter out everything but triples containing a
few given properties, this is easier to set up than to write a SPARQL query. 

The following example configuration demonstrates the configuration of the filter enrichment operator
for filtering only the predicates  `geo:lat`, `geo:long`, `rdfs:label` and `owl:sameAs`.

                [ deer:predicate rdfs:label ] ,
                [ deer:predicate owl:sameAs ] ;
.
```

## Linking Enrichment Operator (`deer:LinkingEnrichmentOperator`) {#linking}

The idea of the linking enrichment operator is to enrich models with links discovered using LIMES. 
It can be used in two modes:
  1. enriching a dataset with links from an external linking process (1 input, 1-2 outputs)  
     * This mode will be selected if the linking enrichment operator node has exactly one input dataset.  
     * If it has exactly one output dataset, it will be the original input dataset enriched with the links.  
     * If it has exactly two output datasets, the first will be just the original input dataset and
     the second will be a dataset of just the generated links.
     * In this mode, the following parameters are accepted:
        - `deer:specFile` which is a path for LIMES specification file
        - `deer:linksPart` one of `"source"`, `"target"`. If `"source"` is selected *(default)*,
        nothing happens. If `"target"` is selected, we swap subjects and objects in the generated links. 
        - `deer:selectMode` determines the strategy for selecting which links to keep from the original
        full limes mapping
           * `"all"` *(default)* all links are kept 
           * `"best1toN"` enforces 1-to-N mapping. For each target resource, only keep the best link to the source. 
           * `"best1to1"` enforces 1-to-1 mapping. No resource in either target or source dataset
           will appear in more than one link.
           * `"best"` keep just the best link. If there are ties, it is unspecified which will be selected.
  2. enriching a dataset with links from an internal linking process (2 inputs, 1-3 outputs)
     * This mode will be selected if the linking enrichment operator node has exactly two input datasets.  
     * If it has exactly one output dataset, it will be the result of merging the two input
     datasets and the generated links  
     * If it has exactly two output datasets, they will correspond to the two input datasets in
     order and depending on the parameter `deer:linksPart`, either the first or the second will
     be enriched with the generated links.
     * If it has exactly three output datasets, they will correspond to the two input datasets
     in order and the third one will be a dataset of just the generated links.
     * In this mode, the following parameters are accepted:
        - `deer:linksPart` one of `"source"`, `"target"`. If `"source"` is selected *(default)*,
        nothing happens. If `"target"` is selected, we swap subjects and objects in the generated links.  
          Moreover, if the number of output datasets is exactly two, this parameter will decide
          which of the two datasets will be enriched with the generated links. If it is "source"
          it will be the first, if it is "target" it will be the second.      
        - `deer:selectMode` determines the strategy for selecting which links to keep from the original full limes mapping
           * `"all"` *(default)* all links are kept 
           * `"best1toN"` enforces 1-to-N mapping. For each target resource, only keep the best link to the source. 
           * `"best1to1"` enforces 1-to-1 mapping. No resource in either target or source dataset will appear in more than one link.
           * `"best"` keep just the best link. If there are ties, it is unspecified which will be selected.
        - `deer:linkSpecification` the link specification to execute (as string literal)
        - `deer:linkingPredicate` the predicate with which links will be built
        - `deer:threshold` the similarity threshold. All links in the resulted mapping will have a
        similarity value greater than or equal to the threshold. 
  
In the following example, the linking enrichment operator is used based on the LIMES configuration
file "limes_specs.xml" and the source dataset is the one to be enriched.
  
```turtle
@prefix : <urn:example:deer-manual/> .
@prefix deer: <https://w3id.org/deer/> .

:node_linking
  a deer:LinkingEnrichmentOperator ;
  deer:specFile "limes_specs.xml" ;
  deer:linksPart "source" ;
.
```

## Dereferencing Enrichment Operator (`deer:DereferencingEnrichmentOperator`) {#deref}

For datasets which contain similarity properties links (e.g. `owl:sameAs`), the idea of the dereferencing
enrichment operator is to deference all links from an externally linked dataset to our input dataset
by using a content negotiation on HTTP.  
This process returns a set of triples that need to be filtered for relevant information.
One dereferencing operation is represented by the `deer:operation` parameter which takes as object
a resource with the following properties:
  * `deer:lookUpPrefix` interesting resources from the external dataset
  * `deer:dereferencingProperty` interesting property to extract from the external dataset 
  * `deer:importProperty` for renaming of the `deer:dereferencingProperty` in the output dataset

One can specify any number of `deer:operation` parameters and they will all be carried out and in
case of overlapping lookup, they will be carried out together to save bandwidth.  
In the following example, the dereferencing enrichment operator is used to find `dbo:abstract` from
external dataset of DBpedia and export them using the `dcterms:description`.

```turtle
@prefix : <urn:example:deer-manual/> .
@prefix deer: <https://w3id.org/deer/> .
@prefix dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/property/> .
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
  
:dereferencing_dbp
  a deer:DereferencingEnrichmentOperator ;
  deer:operation [
    :lookUpPrefix "http://de.dbpedia.org/resource" ;
    :dereferencingProperty dbo:abstract ;
    :importProperty dcterms:description ;
  ] ;
.
```

## NER Enrichment Operator (`deer:NEREnrichmentOperator`) {#ner}

The enrichment information hidden in datatype properties is retrieved by using Named Entity
Recognition (NER) enrichment operator.
In the current version of DEER, we rely on the [FOX framework](http://fox-demo.aksw.org). In the following, we provides
details about the NER operator parameters:
- `deer:literalProperty` Literal property used by FOX for NER. If not set, the top ranked literal
property will be pecked automatically by DEER, which ranks the lateral properties of a model
according to the average size of each literal property divided by the number of instances of such property.
- `deer:importProperty` Property added to be added into the input dataset.
- `deer:neType` Force FOX to look for a specific NE’s types only. Available types are: `"location"` (default value),
`"person"`, `"organization"`, and `"all"` to retrieve the all the previous three types.
- `deer:parallelism` Make use of `N` threads to query FOX in parallel. Useful to speed up computation
when using with a FOX distribution that supports parallel execution.  
	

## Merge Enrichment Operator (`deer:MergeEnrichmentOperator`) {#merge}

The idea behind the merge operator is to enable combining datasets.
The merge operator takes a set of n ≥ 2 input datasets and merges them into one output dataset
containing all the input datasets’ triples. 

In the following example, the merge operator is used to combine the 2 input datasets of
`deer:node_1` and `deer:node_2` into `deer:node_merged`


```turtle
@prefix : <urn:example:deer-manual/> .
@prefix fcage: <https://w3id.org/fcage/> .
@prefix deer: <https://w3id.org/deer/> .

:node_merged
  a deer:MergeEnrichmentOperator ;
  fcage:hasInput ( :node_1 :node_1 ) ;
.
```

## GeoFusion Enrichment Operator (`deer:GeoFusionEnrichmentOperator`) {#geofusion}

The idea of the geo-fusion enrichment operator is to merge two or more input datasets into one
fused output dataset.
In addtion to the common parameters, the geo-fusion operator have the following additional parameter:
- The `deer:fusionAction` is used to specify the how to fuse geo-spatial properties
(by default the `geo:lat` and `geo:long`), the available fusion actions are:
    * `"takeA"` always use geometry from first dataset
    * `"takeB"` always use geometry from second dataset
    * `"takeAll"` merge all geometries
    * `"takeMostDetailed"` use most detailed geometry from any model, e.g., in terms of lexical
    length of latitude and longitude values
 - The `deer:mergeOtherStatements` parameter is used to enable the merge of all other non geo-spacial
 properties from all input dataset to the output dataset

```turtle
@prefix : <urn:example:deer-manual/> .
@prefix fcage: <https://w3id.org/fcage/> .
@prefix deer: <https://w3id.org/deer/> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix geo: <http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .

:node_geofusion
  a deer:GeoFusionEnrichmentOperator ;
  deer:fusionAction "takeAll" ;
  deer:mergeOtherStatements "true"^^xsd:boolean ;
.
```

## Authority Conformation Enrichment Operator (`deer:AuthorityConformationEnrichmentOperator`) {#aconf}

The idea of the authority conformation operator is to change a specified source URI authority to a
specified target URI authority.
One authority conformation operation is represented by the `deer:operation` property.
The objects of `deer:operation` need to be resources with the properties
`deer:sourceAuthority` and `deer:targetAuthority` for specifying the
source and target authorities respectively.
Any number of authority conformation operations can be specified by declaring multiple `deer:operation`
parameters.

In the following example, we use the `deer:sourceAuthority` of `http://dbpedia.org` and the
`deer:targetAuthority` of `http://example.org`.
Such configuration will change a resource like `http://dbpedia.org/Berlin` to `http://example.org/Berlin`. 

```turtle
@prefix : <urn:example:deer-manual/> .
@prefix deer: <https://w3id.org/deer/> .

:node_a_conf
  a deer:AuthorityConformationEnrichmentOperator ;
  deer:operation [ 
    deer:sourceAuthority <http://dbpedia.org> ;
    deer:targetAuthority <http://example.org> .
  ];
.
```

## Predicate Conformation Enrichment Operator (`deer:PredicateConformationEnrichmentOperator`) {#pconf}

The idea of the predicate conformation operator is to replace all instances of specified source
property to a specified target predicated with the same object and subject values.
One predicate conformation operation is represented by the `deer:operation` property.
The objects of `deer:operation` need to be resources with the properties
`deer:sourcePredicate` and `deer:targetPredicate` for specifying the
source and target predicates respectively.
Any number of predicate conformation operations can be specified by declaring multiple `deer:operation`
parameters.

In the following example, we use the predicate conformation enrichment operator to change all
instances of `rdf:label` to `SKOS:prefLabel`.
For example, a triple as `dbp:Berlin rdf:label "Berlin"` will be changed to 
`dbp:Berlin skos:prefLabel "Berlin"`. 

```turtle
@prefix : <urn:example:deer-manual/> .
@prefix deer: <https://w3id.org/deer/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#> .

:node_p_conf
  a deer:PredicateConformationEnrichmentOperator ;
  deer:operation [
    deer:sourcePredicate rdf:label ;
    deer:targetPredicate skos:prefLabel ;
  ] ;
.
```

## GeoDistance Enrichment Operator (`deer:GeoDistanceEnrichmentOperator`) {#geodistance}

The idea of the geo-distance operator is to enrich resources that are connected via
some predicate (configured with parameter `deer:selectPredicate`) with the distance between
their respective geo coordinates.
The distance in kilometers will be added as a string literal to the subject via the predicate specified
in parameter `deer:distancePredicate`. 

In the following example, we use the geo-distance enrichment operator to enrich cities from DBPedia
with the distance to their western adjacent cities. 

```turtle
@prefix : <urn:example:deer-manual/> .
@prefix deer: <https://w3id.org/deer/> .
@prefix dbp : <http://dbpedia.org/property/> .

:node_geodistance
  a deer:GeoDistanceEnrichmentOperator ;
  deer:selectPredicate dbp:west ; 
  deer:distancePredicate :distanceToNextCityInTheWest ;
.
```

## SPARQL Update Enrichment Operator (`deer:SparqlUpdateEnrichmentOperator`) {#update}

The SPARQL Update Enrichment Operator is used to execute a SPARQL UPDATE operation on an input
dataset.
It takes the single parameter `deer:sparqlUpdateQuery` which must be a valid SPARQL UPDATE query
and executes it on its only input.
In the following example we use the operator to update all given names of "Bill" to "William". 

```turtle
@prefix : <urn:example:deer-manual/> .
@prefix deer: <https://w3id.org/deer/> .

:node_update
  a deer:SparqlUpdateEnrichmentOperator;
  deer:sparqlUpdateQuery """
    PREFIX foaf:  <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
    DELETE { ?person foaf:givenName 'Bill' }
    INSERT { ?person foaf:givenName 'William' }
    WHERE
      {
        ?person foaf:givenName 'Bill'
      }  
  """ ; 
.
```
